- For the C0 computation we set:
   - mainC0Size -  the number of modes taken for the differential inclusion,
   - fullC0Size - the number of modes represented exsplicitly.
- The rigrous C0 integration is done in odd subspace of Fourier coefficients.

- For the C1 we set:
   - mainC1Size -  the number of modes taken for the differential inclusion for each variable $(u,h)$ ,
   - fullC1Size - the number of modes represented exsplicitly for each variable $(u,h)$ ,
   - expColumns - number of columns of the derivative computed explicitly.

- The rigrous C1 integration is done in full space not in the Odd subspace.
- For C1 integration we have variables the variational eqation, so the real number of modes takes for differetial incusion is 2*mainC1Size and the number of modes represented explicitly is equal to 2*fullC1Size.
- Rest of the columns are computed by commansing them to the one set  the form

$$
    X^{0,h} = \sum_{i=expColumns+1}^\infty u_i \sin(ix),\quad \text{where }u_i\in[-1,1].

## ChafeeInfante\findPeriodicPoint

Program for finding periodic orbits of the Chafee-Infate equation. It tries to find a fixed periodic point by iterating the Galerkin approximation of the map.

$$
T(u_0) = u(1,0;u_0).
$$

- The initial data for searching is taken from the content of file `ChafeeInfante\textFiles\initialValue.txt`. This initial data determines the size of the Galerkin projection.
- It assumes that parameter $\omega = 2\pi$, so the value of $\omega$ in file `ChafeeInfante\textFiles\params.txt` does not matter.
- It outputs the proposed approximation of the founded periodic orbit at zero. It also outputs an approximation of the variational matrix for the map $T$.


## ChafeeInfante\CAProof.cpp

This program is designed to prove the existence of a periodic orbit and demonstrate its local attraction. It does so by checking whether a defined set $X_0$ satisfies the following condition:

$$ T(X_0) \subset X_0 $$

If this condition is satisfied, it confirms the existence of a periodic orbit. The program utilizes a rigorous C0 algorithm for integrating partial differential equations (PDEs) to compute the image. Additionally, it attempts to prove that the orbit is locally attracting by verifying:

$$
||\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}(X_0)||_{C_0} < 1.
$$

The computation of derivatives employs a rigorous C1 integration algorithm.

Here are some details about the program and its inputs:

- The set $X_0$ is centered around an initial condition $u^0$ read from `ChafeeInfante\textFiles\initialValue.txt`.
- Options for setting up the assisted proof can be found in `ChafeeInfante\textFiles\sampleDynOptions.txt`, including parameters such as:
```
1e-4 1 3 
6 14
9 17 0
-------------
eps , C, s
mainC0Size, fullC0Size
mainC1Size, fullC1Size, expColumns

```
- The set $X_0$ is defined as follows:
   $$X^0 = X_P^o + X_Q^o,$$
  
where
$$X_P^o = u^o(x)+ [-1,1]eps*\sum_{i=1}^n \sin((2i-1)x),$$

and

$$
    X_Q^o = \sum_{i=n+11}^\infty \frac{C[-11]}{(2i-11)^s}\sin((2i-11)x).
$$

Here, $n$ depends on the size of the initial condition.

- For C0 computation, the parameters are set as follows:
   - `mainC0Size`: The number of modes considered for the differential inclusion.
   - `fullC0Size`: The number of modes explicitly represented.
   
The rigorous C0 integration is performed in the odd subspace of Fourier coefficients.

- For C1 computation, the parameters are set as follows:
   - `mainC1Size`: The number of modes considered for each variable $(u,h)$ in the differential inclusion.
   - `fullC1Size`: The number of modes explicitly represented for each variable $(u,h)$.
   - `expColumns`: Number of columns where derivatives are computed explicitly.

The rigorous C1 integration is conducted in full space, not just in the odd subspace. In this case, there are variables representing variational equations. Therefore, the actual number of modes used for differential inclusion is $2 \times \text{mainC1Size}$ and the number of modes explicitly represented is $2 \times \text{fullC1Size}$.

The remaining columns are computed by setting them to be:

$$
    X^{o,h} = \sum_{i=\text{expColumns}+11}^\infty u_i\sin(ix),\quad \text{where } u_i\in[-11].
$$
